### 📌 Description
This assignment uses Sass to build a modular and scalable webpage. It includes semantic HTML, reusable components with `@extend`, global variables with `@use`, and clean imports via `@import`.

---

### 🛠️ Features Implemented

1. **HTML Layout**
   - Semantic structure (`header`, `main`, `footer`).
   - Uses Google Fonts and modern layout techniques.

2. **SCSS Modularization**
   - `variables.scss`: Defines colors, font families, and spacing.
   - `header.scss` & `footer.scss`: Layout and styling for each section.
   - `style.scss`: Entry point that imports all partials.

3. **Use of @extend**
   - Feature boxes ("Learning", "Philosophy", "Practice", "Games") share a common base but vary by color.

---

### 🧠 Notes
- Each SCSS file is maintainable and self-contained.
- The compiled output is a single CSS file that styles the entire page.
- Design is clean, responsive-friendly, and thematically appropriate.

---

### ✅ Status
Fully completed and functional — all project goals achieved.
